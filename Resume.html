  <body>
    <p href="paragraph-one">I started my first time coding when I was in high school and loved that environment even if it was a classroom. Collaborating with other programmers/peers and learning new stuff together but I stopped after and never picked it up again.
      I originally wanted to become a Project Manager because I saw the market and wanted to tap into it through Coursera since I had no money for college and didn't want to go through having debt and i was working a part time job through a company that was involved with Metals for packing/shipping them. I wanted to take a leap of faith and begin studying and going for my Project Management career but through all of this experience I had lost my dad who had passed away from Cardiac Arrest later in 2023.
    </p>
    
    <p href="paragraph-two">I told my father I wanted to become a Project Manager before he passed away and I kept working hard towards the goal and even had a few jobs reach back out to me for opportunities to grow under them and shadow under their wing. I saw the market for project management and realised it was for construction and I wanted to be apart of the IT area of Project Management so I stopped my learning and paused on Project Management, I later heard my friends were working on coding and talked about how fun it was and it brought me back to my memories of working with my peers/programmers doing basic game code and reminded me how fun it was but I ad no where to start or a platform to put my feet on to begin my journey</p>
    
    <p href="paragraph-three">
      I have always been a person who has done thorough research before I just talk about a subject so I started to do research on how to become a Software Engineer. I found a mobile/Desktop application called "Programming Hub" and began to learn about the basics of Software Engineering for SDLC, Models, Feasibility Study, Software Requirements, Software Designs, Modularization, Black box/White box Testing, including the basics of Javascript. With my friends help they recommended me "Team Tree house" which I have begun other projects learning HTML, CSS and created my own basic portfolio and Resume
